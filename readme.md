# Seattle CoderDojo App Inventor Orientation Workshop

Today we're going to experiment with moving things on the screen by moving the screen.

## Understanding Pitch and Roll

For our first experiment, we're going to create a simple display that shows us the numbers that are generated when we tilt our devices.

We'll start a new project, called "Orientation 1."

In it, we'll put 2 horizontal arrangements from the "Layout" menu, and in each horizontal arrangement we'll put two labels from the "User Interface" menu.

**Horizontal Arrangement 1**

Set width to "fill parent"

* 1st label rename to "pitchLabel," change the font size to 18, and the text to "Pitch: "
* 2nd label rename to "pitchValue," change the font size to 18, and the text to nothing.

**Horizontal Arrangement 2**

Set width to "fill parent"

- 1st label rename to "rollLabel," change the font size to 18, and the text to "Pitch: "
- 2nd label rename to "rollValue," change the font size to 18, and the text to nothing.

From the "Sensors" menu, pull an Orientation Sensor onto the screen.
